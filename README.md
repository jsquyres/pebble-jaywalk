# "Jaywalk" Pebble watchface

This is a pretty simple watch face.  Here's what it looks like:

And here it is with the battery percentage:

Here's my goals for this watchface:

1. Show the time, including the seconds.  I'm a precise guy; I like seeing the seconds.
1. The time should be in big, bold, easy-to-read numbers.  My eyes are geting old.  :-)
1. Show the date, including the weekday name.  See above; I'm a precise guy -- I like seeing this information (and therefore not having to think about/remember what weekday it is).
1. Show the battery percentage:
   1. When it's <= 30%.
   1. When it's plugged in (so I can tell when it's done charging)
   1. If I get curious, shake my wrist and show the current battery percentage for 5 seconds (even if it's > 30%).

Someday, I plan to add pedometer functionality in here, mainly because I'm not fully satisfied with the other pedometer apps.

Someday.  :-)
